Hello! I am a front-end engineer responsible for developing and maintaining the robot control system. I have a strong passion for software technology, with a particular focus on code improvement and design patterns.

As a front-end engineer, I specialize in building robust and efficient web applications, particularly in the field of robot control systems. I am always eager to learn and improve, and I enjoy exploring new software technologies and design patterns to optimize my code.

My technical expertise includes JavaScript, React, and TypeScript, which I use to create seamless and user-friendly interfaces. In addition, I am well-versed in various tools such as Git, AWS, CloudFront, Route53, EC2, and S3, which I use to manage and deploy my projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see the projects I've worked on and the skills I've developed. Don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss any projects!
